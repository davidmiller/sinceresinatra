        There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice
think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say
to itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought
it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have
wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);

      <p>
        but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS
WAISTCOAT- POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried
on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that
she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and
burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop
down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

out again.
